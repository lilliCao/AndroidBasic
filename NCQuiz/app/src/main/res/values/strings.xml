                    I call this quiz NC. If you are german, don\'t worry.
                    There is nothing to do with the Numerus Clausus, not with exams at all.
                    Its name is Nerd Check. It\'s a small quiz to check how nerd you are :)
                    Or let\'s say there are some funny questions for you to entertain:)
                    \nThere are some questions where you can only choice 1 unique answer(with circle)
                     and some you can choose more(with square).
                    \nPay attention to the question before you head any answer
                    \nPress submit if you are sure about the answer. Submit will block you from that question
                    since it will show you the answer after pressing
                    \nIf you don\'t have enough time to see the answer. Don\'t worry, you can take a look at all the QA at the end
                    Press &lt;&lt;see QA&gt;&gt; button at the end to see all the answer with explanation
                    \nOk. Enough text. I hope you have fun checking your nerd level
                    \nStay foolish. Stay hungry.
                    \nBe passionate. Be curious.
                    \nBe a nerd
