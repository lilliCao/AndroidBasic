        \n The rule of the game is very simple.
        \n You need to connect all the platines together.
        \n The line between platines is seen as the capacity of both platines.
        \n Each platine need to have as many lines going in as the capacity showed next to the platine
        \n You are not allowed to connect 2 platines when another platine is located in between or a loading line is already there
        \n There are maximal 2 loading lines going to a platine
        \n Good luck

        \n I offer you a small GUI to test the game.
        \n I don\'t support land mode here. Mean don\'t rotate your application while playing
        \n Choose a level from the top down panel and click load button to load the game
        \n Click on the platine to choose. 2 chosen platines to be applied rule will be marked white. The others is blue
        \n You can use connect button to connect between 2 chosen platines
        \n You can use remove button to remove your current loading lines. Each time you can only remove 1 linea.
        \n You can test your result any time you want by check button
        \n Remember if the result is right. I will block the gui for that level. Because I take in consideration that you want
        to go to next level
